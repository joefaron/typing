    "text": "Linus Torvalds created Linux in 1991 as a hobby project while studying at the University of Helsinki. He announced it on a Usenet newsgroup with the humble message that it was just a hobby and would not be big like GNU. Linux now powers everything from smartphones with Android to supercomputers and cloud infrastructure. Torvalds is famous for his direct communication style and strong opinions on code quality. He also created Git in 2005 after BitKeeper revoked free licenses, revolutionizing version control for developers worldwide."
