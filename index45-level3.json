    "text": "Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in a Stanford dorm room in 1996. They originally called it BackRub because it analyzed backlinks. The name Google comes from googol, a mathematical term for the number one followed by one hundred zeros. Sergey Brin is known for his love of playing guitar and can often be found jamming at company events. Google's first investor was Andy Bechtolsheim, who wrote a check for one hundred thousand dollars before the company was even incorporated."
