    "text": "Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak founded Apple Computer in Jobs' parents' garage in 1976. Wozniak designed the Apple I computer while working at HP, doing all the work after hours. Jobs sold his Volkswagen van and Wozniak sold his HP calculator to raise capital. The Apple II, released in 1977, became one of the first successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs was famously ousted from Apple in 1985, only to return in 1997 and save the company from bankruptcy with the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad."
